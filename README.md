Regular numbers (also known as 5-smooth and Hamming numbers) are numbers whose only prime divisors are 2, 3 and 5. First 15 regular numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number

This simple algorithm finds the *n*th regular number in O(n) time. Requires Java Development Kit. Compile the program with ```javac RegularNumbers.java``` . Run the algorithm with ```java RegularNumbers <n>```, where `<n>` is the index of the number you are looking for.
